<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Zach Keneson an I'm an aspiring web developer. I have spent the last 10 or so years in sales,
   working within beverage distribution and tech companies. I enjoy engaging with people from all walks of life, understanding their needs, 
   and delivering the best solution possible. </p>

<p>I have spent countless hours watching Youtube videos, reading articles, and researching different industries within the tech space.
  I have always been interested in tech and the many facets it is comprised of. One day, I came across a software development channel 
  and started watching it's most popular videos. I then spent the next few weeks learning more and more and absorbing as much as I possibly could. 
</p>

<p>This eventually led me to Udemy, where I found web development courses. I am currently working through my first course, getting more excited 
  after each module I complete. Once I have finished this course, comprised of HTML,CSS, and Javascript, my goal is to start building websites for local businesses.</p>
